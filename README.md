# SeleniumYahooBot
this is a selenium and yahoo bot to help you not miss any emails. it logs in to your yahoomail and sends the latest emails as a whatsapp text message using twilio api

i know this can be done very easily and better using a mail api but i wanted to do it using selenium

this started as a gmail project since i wasn't getting notifications from my gmail app anymore. gmail had blocked automated log in so i switched to project to yahoo.
